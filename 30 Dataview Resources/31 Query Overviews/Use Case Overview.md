Our **Use Cases** are Query Overviews that fit for a certain application case, that serve a specific goal and be quite distinct, small or big depending the topic. They should help you if you, for example, search for ways to make your daily notes more useful but don't have a grasp yet what _exactly_ you are searching. 

We hope the Use Cases aid you to find inspiration and helpful queries that make your note taking better, more fun and more efficient.
