# Pesto Pasta

## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 [quantity homemade pesto](https://www.recipetineats.com/pesto/) (Note 1)
- [ ] 300 - 350 g / 10 - 12 oz pasta of choice (ziti, penne and spaghetti are my favourites, Note 2)
- [ ] 2 tsp salt
- [ ] 3/4 cup pasta cooking water
- [ ] Parmesan, for serving

## Instructions

### Instructions

-   Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the salt.
    
-   Add pasta and cook for the length of time per the packet.
    
-   Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water.
    
-   Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute.
    
-   Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot).
    
-   Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky.
    
-   Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired.
    
-   Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parmesan.
