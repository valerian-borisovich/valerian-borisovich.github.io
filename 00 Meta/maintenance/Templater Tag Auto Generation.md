# Templater Tag Auto Generation

If you add query pages at a regular basis and/or find it annoying to scroll through the page and typing out tags, then I've good news! 

Since I answered all the above with a "Yes", I wrote a utility that auto-generates the fitting tags for you. 

## Set up
1. Install the community plugin `Templater` and enable it
2. In its options, insert `00 Meta/templater_templates` as Template Folder Location

## How to use

1. First, write all your queries. Your query page needs to be complete.
2. Place your cursor at the top of the page (right below the frontmatter) and hit ALT + E (this is the default for opening Templater's Template Modal)
3. Choose `insert tags to query page`
4. Done!
