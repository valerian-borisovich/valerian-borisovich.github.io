## Control field from dataview tables with dataviewjs

- fieldName: the name of the field you want to display (as string)
- attrs (optional): an object with the attributes you want to pass to the field:
    - cls (optional): the class to be applied to the field
    - attr (optional): the dataview attributes for the field (they will be included as data tags in the HTML rendering of the field)
    - options (optional): an object containing specific options for Metadata Menu field modification

### options

#### alwaysOn

with `options: {alwaysOn: true}` the control for the field will always be displayed

with `options: {alwaysOn: false}` (default) the control for the field won't always be displayed, you'll have to click on an intermediate button or hover the field to display the control

#### showAddField

dv.table(["file", "Masterization", "Tune"], 
        dv.pages()
        .where(p => p.fileClass === "music")
        .map(p => [
            p.file.link, 
            f(dv, p, "masterization", {options: {alwaysOn: true}}),  // pass dv (dataview api instance), p (the page), the field name to fieldModifier (: "f") and an object with options: {alwaysOn: true} so taht the control is always visible
            f(dv, p, "tune") // pass dv (dataview api instance), p (the page), and the field name to fieldModifier (: "f")
